# Natal Dispersal and Mass Analysis Notes

## Overview

- Focus: **36 natal dispersed males** and their relationship to mass, habitat, and reproductive success.
    
- Mass is considered a **good index of overall body size**.
    

## Mass and Reproductive Success

- Reproductive success relative to habitat variation is **not linked**:
    
    - Applies across all habitats: city, rural, conifer, deciduous.
        
- **Intrinsic features of birds** _do_ link to reproductive success:
    
    - Bigger birds reproduce earlier.
        
    - Becoming a territorial breeder is linked to size.
        

## Natal Dispersal Predictions and Patterns

### Direction and Distance Expectations

- Natal dispersal detections:
    
    - Directional movement should **not be significantly linked to any cardinal direction**.
        
    - Should **not exhibit any distance relationship**.
        
    - No relationship between **distance moved and size**.
        

### A Priori Prediction

- Successful dispersion is based on **size**, not habitat.
    
- Expectation: detect **bigger males outside of natal areas**.
    
- Key idea: _size matters, habitat doesn’t_.
    

## Brood Size and Parental Effects

- Bigger birds tend to come from **bigger brood sizes**, which:
    
    - Start earlier in the year.
        
    - Are associated with larger mates.
        
- Bigger males mate with **bigger females**.
    

### Brood Statistics

- Average young per brood: **3.7 birds**.
    
- Natal dispersed males average: **4.3 birds per brood**.
    

### Prediction

- Natal dispersed males that are bigger should come from **bigger broods**.
    
- Bigger size correlates with:
    
    - Bigger parents.
        
    - Parents who lay more eggs earlier.
        

## Long-Term Mass Dataset (46 Years)

- All masses tallied from **caught males and nestling stage birds**.
    
- Average mass: **329 g** (~330 g).
    
- Mass has **not changed across years**:
    
    - Each new year added still averages ~330 g.
        
    - Stable across each generational period (6–7 years).
        
- Natal dispersed birds (34 males) appear to be **linked to mass**.
    

## Habitat vs Intrinsic Features

- Variation in reproductive success with raptors is often attributed to habitat variation.
    
- Rosenfield cannot explain this with habitat data alone.
    
- Only **intrinsic features**, especially size, explain patterns.
    

## Territory Fidelity

- Once a COHA finds a territory, they remain there **for the rest of their lives**.
    

## Non-dispersal bird's have unknown origins

- The origins of **n = 375 birds** are unknown.
    

## Habitat and Seasonal Effects on Fitness

- Habitat is a **co-dominant predictor** along with size for fitness in many birds.
    
- Early hatching in a seasonal environment:
    
    - Higher latitudes → more seasonal dependencies.
        
    - Raptors have higher broods earlier in the season.
        
    - Earlier birth provides:
        
        - Longer lifespan window in the season.
            
        - More experience.
            
        - More time to disperse farther.
            
        - More time to evaluate habitats.
            

## Regional Dispersal Observations

- 35 years of trapping birds in Milwaukee:
    
    - No dispersed birds showed up in Milwaukee.
        
- Collaboration in Grand Forks, ND (25-year study):
    
    - No birds have appeared in Wisconsin from Grand Forks.
        
    - No Wisconsin birds appeared in Grand Forks.
        
- Despite this separation:
    
    - Grand Forks birds share the same genes as Wisconsin birds.
        
    - Birds likely disperse ~12 miles at a time to reach new areas.
        
- Study area is large enough to accurately determine that:
    
    - Average natal dispersal in males is **contained within the study area**.
        

## Size vs Distance Analysis (34 Natal Dispersed Males)

- Question: Is there a correlation between movement distance and size?
    
- Assumption: Habitat is suitable anywhere.
    
- Method:
    
    - Regressed size onto distance.
        
- Result:
    
    - **No relationship** between size and distance moved.
        
    - Even the biggest birds do not necessarily move farther.
        
    - Suggests habitat may not be a strong predictor.
        

## Wing Chords

- Wing chords correlate with size.
    
- Data source: **incoming Excel sheet**.
    

## Visualization Plans

### Ridgeline / Overlapped Violin Plots

- Show each generation’s **wing chord (WC)** and **mass distribution curves**.
    
- Exclude the 34 dispersed males from frequency distributions.
    
- Generational grouping:
    
    - 1980–1985 = 6 years = 1 generation.
        
- Plot details:
    
    - X-axis: male mass in a 6-year period.
        
    - Y-axis: frequency.
        
    - Include mean line.
        
    - Add black dots or axis hashes indicating:
        
        - Average natal dispersed male mass for each generational period.
            

### Starburst Analysis

- Single overall diagram capturing:
    
    - Direction.
        
    - Distance.
        
    - Optional: mass (represented by arrow width).
        
- Longer lines represent greater movement distance.
    

## Overall Summary

- Mass is a central intrinsic predictor of dispersal and reproductive timing.
    
- Habitat plays a limited or co-dominant role depending on context.
    
- Dispersal direction and distance are not strongly size-dependent.
    
- Long-term datasets show stable average mass across decades.
    
- Visualization strategies will emphasize generational distributions and dispersal patterns.
